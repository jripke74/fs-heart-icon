# fs-heart-icon

In this workshop, you will practice working with SVGs by building a heart icon

Step 1
In a previous lecture, you learned about svg elements and how they're often used as icons in projects. In real-world codebases, you would typically rely on icon libraries, so you don't need to create svg elements from scratch. However, in this workshop, you'll build a heart icon to learn about the core attributes used inside an svg element.

Start by creating an svg element on the page.
