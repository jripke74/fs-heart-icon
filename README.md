# fs-heart-icon

In this workshop, you will practice working with SVGs by building a heart icon

Step 1
In a previous lecture, you learned about svg elements and how they're often used as icons in projects. In real-world codebases, you would typically rely on icon libraries, so you don't need to create svg elements from scratch. However, in this workshop, you'll build a heart icon to learn about the core attributes used inside an svg element.

Start by creating an svg element on the page.

Step 2
The next step is to set the width and height attributes for the svg element. As you are creating an icon, both values should be set small.

Set both values to 24.
